# Kaleido-Export

## Scope
This repository is a collection of notebooks and scripts used by the HCCS facility at BRIC to handle the images generated on the Ensight multinode plate reader.

## Running Jupyter Notebooks
There are several ways to run jupyter notebooks in different ide's. In order to easily run them locally, we recommend installing and running [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/install).

## 1. sort_kaleido_images
This jupyter notebook autoscales the images and stores the images as jpg in a new directory. 
This notebook is meant to provide easier visualization/access to the data, and not for scientific evaluation of the images. For scientific evaluation, please use the raw images instead.
